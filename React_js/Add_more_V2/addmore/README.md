React Task - 8 Add More


- Design a page like attached image:
- Add more buttons will add a similar box below the main box.
- Add child will add a child in the respective parent.
- The delete button will delete the child.
- Submit button will append details of that box under “SPECIFICATION” section
- The order of the left side table and right side details will remain the same
- If someone submits the 3rd table first and then submits the 2nd table then at the specification side, the first 2nd table will display and then the 3rd - table. Order of submission is not important. The order of the table is important.
- If you add/delete a child after submitting that table then it will affect the right side when you submit that table a second time.
