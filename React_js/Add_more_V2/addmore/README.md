*Submit button will append details of that box under “SPECIFICATION” section
*The order of the left side table and right side details will remain the same
*If someone submits the 3rd table first and then submits the 2nd table then at the specification side, the first 2nd table will display and then the 3rd table. *Order of submission is not important. The order of the table is important.
*If you add/delete a child after submitting that table then it will affect the right side when you submit that table a second time.
